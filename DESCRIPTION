Description: We extend the idea of joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) 
have enabled researchers to move from species-level analyses to community-level 
analyses, leading to statistically more efficient and ecologically more 
informative use of data. Here we propose joint species movement modelling (JSMM) 
as an analogous approach that enables one to infer both species- and 
community-level movement parameters from multi-species capture-recapture data. 
    The species-level movement parameters are modelled as a function of species 
traits and/or their phylogenetic relationships, allowing one to ask how species 
traits influence movements, and whether phylogenetically related species are more 
similar in their movement patterns than expected from the measured traits. 
    Joint species movement modelling also makes it possible to predict the 
movement parameters of species not present in the training data, based on their 
trait values and position in the phylogeny.
